% Part 1: Warm up Examples
% M-file name: /src/Part1/Warmup.m
% Notes: Scripts include plotting various signals in MATLAB
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Warmup

% Part 2: Spectral Analysis
% M-file name: /src/Part2/SpectralAnalysis.m
% Notes: 
%   - The MATLAB part includes a script generated signal 
%   - The second part is a .wav file of my voice
%   - Both parts are observed in the Frequency domain
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

SpectralAnalysis

% Part 3: Discrete Fourier Transform on Audio and Image files
% M-file name: /src/Part3/DCT.m
% Notes: 
%   - Image Compression is demonstrated on a colored image on img.m script
%   - Fourier Transform is executed on preloaded his/her audio files in audio.m script

% Part 4: Piano Chord Recognition
% M-file name: /src/Part4/main.m 
% Notes: 
%   - Piano Chords consists of 3 notes at different frequencies, granted in the 
%       same key
%   - This scripts identifies Major chords, including different inversions
%   - First script, NoteRecog.m, demonstrates note recognition using First Maximum 
%       Value identification using a threshold
%   - Second script, ChordRecog.m, utilizes the methods of NoteRecog.m and applies
%       them to Chord Recognition
%           - Chord recognition is done by identifying the first 3 max peaks of the
%               frequency spectrum and comparing them to audible note frquencies
%               given by notestable.csv.  After the notes are identified, the 3 pair
%               is compared to a chord table that analyzes the note combination, thus
%               resulting in a chord
